# csc235-snackDispenser
This is a motion sensored snack dispenser using a stepper motor powered wheel to drop a snack or candy into a drawer when it detects motion. 
The code is used to detect the distance from the Ultrasonic Range Finder and use that to determine when someone has moved in front of the sensor which
then turns the stepper motor 90 degrees.
